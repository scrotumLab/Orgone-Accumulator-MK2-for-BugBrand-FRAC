# Orgone-Accumulator-MK2-for-BugBrand-FRAC

With permission of Neutron Sound, Scrotum Lab made this version of Orgone Accumulator in FRAC format compatible with the BugBrand Modular System.
I called it MK2 because I added some functionality not present on the open source DIY version of Neutron Sound.

In this repository you will find:

    • The PCB files in Diptrace format. Boards and schematics.
    • The front panel as PCB in Diptrace format.
    • The PCB file as GERBER
